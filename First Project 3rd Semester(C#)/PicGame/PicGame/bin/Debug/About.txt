This game was made from Fotis Stavropoulos.I'm a student at the department of Computer Science at University of Piraeus and this was a mini third semester project for C# course. 
It is a beta version and new updates will come shortly.
You can also contribute to the game by giving me a feedback.
This project was finished at 18/11/2019.
