Stats are being displayed as long as you play just to inform you of your progress.
Everytime you finish a game against the computer or another player you can always go back to the main menu and check on your stats.
You can erase your stats whenever you want BUT you won't be able to undo your choice meaning that all of your progress will be lost.
Stats help you improve your skills and show your opponents who the real master is!
